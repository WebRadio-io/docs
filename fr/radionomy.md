# Getting the Current Song from your Radionomy Webradio

WebRadio.io can work with Radionomy in order to retrieve the current song being played by Radionomy, and display it on your webradio.io page.

You will need two data in order to activate this feature: your **Radio ID** and your **API KEY**.

Once you have those informations, you can enable the Radionomy Current Song System by going to your Webradio Settings Section and then go to "Update Current Song System".

A new menu will appear and you can choose "Radionomy API" in the list.

In the 2 input that appeared on the right, enter your Radio ID and your API KEY. Click on the "Try" button and see the magic happening!

Finally, save your modification.
